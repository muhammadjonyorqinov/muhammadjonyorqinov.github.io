	<h1>About Myself</h1>
	<p>Hi! My name is Mukhammadjon. I’m 19 and I live in Tashkent which is the capital of Uzbekistan. Actually I come from another city - Andijan, where I lived for eighteen years.</p>
<p>
I’m interested in computer science, music and sport. Computers first appered in my life when I was seven. Then I had got my first computer. It was Acer and I remember myself thinking, that it was the best thing in the world. I was playing it whenever I could. Then I had got my first PC. At first, I was just playing computer games, but some time later, I noticed that I could do a lot more things with the computer, for example programming. Now, I can already programme in Pascal, C++ and HTML. I have my own site on the internet and I have done many programmes. I hope that in the future I will get a job as a computer scientist.</p>
<p>My favorite music singer is Taylor Swift. I think it is the best singer on the earth. Together with my sister, we are devoted Taylor's fans. We have all her albums, many video tapes, books, posters, gadgets and interviews. I like her songs, but I also like other singers like Charlie Puth , The Baeatles, The Backstreet boys and many others. Apart from that I’m really fascinated by  Russian  songs.</p>
<p>I have always been good at sports. I like playing soccer, running and swimming. I have played in many sport tournaments in which together with my team, I have won many trophys. My favorite intelectual game is chess, but I have never played it professionaly.</p>
<p>I love fantasy literature. I read fantasy books and magazines, watch fantasy films and play role playing games in which fantasy world is used as background. Once every two weeks, I meet with my friends and we play „Middle Earth”. I’m the master of the game and they are players. We play about five hours sesion. It’s a lot of fun. „Middle Earth” is a game based on Tolkien’s books. I chose it, because I love everything that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote. He is my favorite writer, but I like other writers as well, for example Piers Anthony or Robert Jordan. </p>
